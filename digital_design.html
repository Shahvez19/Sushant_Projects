    <h2>About this Subject</h2>
    <p><br>

        Digital Design and Computer Architecture is a fundamental subject in computer science and electrical
        engineering that focuses on the principles of designing digital circuits and understanding computer system
        architecture. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects, enabling students to build efficient digital
        systems and understand how computers function at a hardware level. <br>
        <br>
