    <h1><u>Object Oriented Programming Using Advance Java</u> </h1>
    <h2>About this Subject</h2>
    <p>
        Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).
        It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" principle, meaning Java programs can run on any platform with a
        Java Virtual Machine (JVM). <br>
        It is widely used for building applications ranging from desktop software to web and
        mobile applications.
        <br><br>
    <h3>Advanced Java </h3>
    Advanced Java refers to the specialized topics and APIs used for building enterprise-level applications. It
    includes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), Hibernate, Spring, and Web
    Services. Advanced Java is mainly used for developing web-based, distributed, and networking applications.
