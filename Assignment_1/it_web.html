    <h2>About this Subject</h2> <br>
    <p> <b>Internet</b> <br>
        The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that allows users to share information and
        communicate. It operates through protocols like TCP/IP and enables access to websites, emails, social media,
        online services, and more. The World Wide Web (WWW) is a major part of the internet, consisting of web pages
        linked through hyperlinks and accessible via browsers.
        <br>
        <b>Web Designing</b> <br>
        Web designing is the process of creating and structuring websites to ensure an engaging and user-friendly
        experience. It involves both aesthetics (layout, colors, typography) and functionality (navigation,
        responsiveness). Web designers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, along with tools like Adobe XD,
        Figma, and WordPress. A well-designed website should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and optimized for
        different devices.
