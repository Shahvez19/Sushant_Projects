    <h2>About this Subject </h2>
    <p>
        The Analysis and Design of Algorithms is a fundamental subject in computer science that focuses on
        developing efficient solutions to computational problems. It involves: <br>

        1. Algorithm Design:Creating step-by-step procedures to solve problems optimally. Common techniques
        include: <br>
        - Divide and Conquer(e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort) <br>
        - Greedy Algorithms(e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm) <br>
        - Dynamic Programming(e.g., Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem) <br>
        - Backtracking and Branch & Bound(e.g., N-Queens Problem, Traveling Salesman Problem) <br> <br>

        2. Algorithm Analysis:Evaluating the performance of algorithms in terms of time complexity (Big-O
        notation) and space complexity to ensure scalability and efficiency. <br> <br>

        3. Complexity Classes:Understanding different problem categories such as P, NP, NP-Hard, and
        NP-Complete, which help in determining problem-solving feasibility. <br> <br>

        This subject is essential for optimizing applications, solving real-world computational problems, and preparing
        for coding interviews. </p>
